Rent Manager - UNCC ITCS 3112 Group Project
------------------------------------------------------------
Rent Manager is a simple bill calculator which will allow
you to add bills and roommates and calculates their bill total
for the current month. It has a prorate function that allows a
certain roommate to pay a particular percentage more than the
others and deducts that prorate from the other roommates.

Rent Manager was created specifically for a class group project
and is not meant to be distributed. Please refrain from using
any code in this project as your own.
